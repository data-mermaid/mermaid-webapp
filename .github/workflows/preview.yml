# This workflow creates deploy previews for pull requests in the S3 Bucket: "preview.datamermaid.org"
# Deploy previews are created in the subfolders of the S3 bucket, allowing multiple react applications to be running in a single bucket
# Note: This workflow requires the bucket to already have been created,
#       along with the right bucket policy to allow actions on s3 objects,
#       as well as public read access
